		<p>Do you have a habbit you want to form or simply keep up? We have just the kind of thing you nee. We have a 
		sensor that a user can stick on anything:floss kit, pill bottle, running shoes, you name it we got it.
		This sensor then links to an app on you Android and iOS devise. You set a time and when the sensor 
		moves, the mobile app timer is reset (Congrats, you remembered to do something and are on your way to forming 
		a habit!). If the sensor doesn't move after a certain period of time and the timers hit zero, the iOS and 
		Android Apps send push notifications to the user telling them to do the required activity (and thus forming a 
		habit).</p>
